Battleship
==========

The old battleship game, let's try to make it more interesting..!


Intro:
I am totally new to Github and to the ObjC language, but I really want to get better soon!
So this is my first project: a remake of the old boring battleship game with some additional features to make it more interesting.
I already have a couple of ideas but I m very open to yours aswell.
Don't have huge expectations for now, to make it work and learn from it as much as I can would be great.
To turn it into a real app and share it on the app store it would be awesome aswell!!

Because there s no way I can do this by my self, here I am.
I wrote down the code as far as my little knowledge allowed me.
There s no graphic for now, just some ugly output prints made of strings of char to visualize the battlefield and the boats.
Its kinda working, but not always...and I d like to know why :)

So what I did is:

Boat class: the basic boat element;
Field class: creates a bidimensional array of char that is the field grid where the boats are placed and the user shoots;
Player class: this class manages the user actions, there will be more then just shooting...so much more!!;

What I have to do:

Improve the existing classes: everything I ve done its weak code and needs to be perfectioned;
Game class: manages the entire game, player rounds, and whatever needs to be done;
Graphic interface: of course an awesome game needs a spectacular graphic, unfortunately at the moment my knowledge is Zero :) so I m gona need huge help here.


Ok so let's start this adventure!!
I'll add new stuff every day if I can, but I really want to hear from you guys, opinions, ideas, coomments, feel free to be honest please.
